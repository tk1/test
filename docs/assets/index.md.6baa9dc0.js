These tasks can be combined into assignments. The students are to solve the tasks. The system automatically evaluates and grades the solution. The students are assigned a rating number that increases as the knowledge of the students increases.</p><p>Doatask can operate as a external tool provider for learning platforms such as <a href="https://moodle.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moodle</a>. The platform must comply to Learning Tools Interoperability 1.3 (LTI).</p><blockquote><p>The IMS Learning Tools Interoperability® (LTI®) specification allows Learning Management Systems (LMS) or platforms to integrate remote tools and content in a standard way. <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a></p></blockquote><p>Doatask has a plugin system. A plugin offers one or more task types. This means that the system is not fixed to certain task types, but can be extended dynamically.</p>',9)];s.render=function(a,o,s,r,n,l){return e(),t("div",null,i)};export{o as __pageData,s as default};
